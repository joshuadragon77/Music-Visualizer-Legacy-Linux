These Java Programs represent my early days of programming and early days of my Music Visualizing series. lol

Finally ported them _lazily_ but it works. They support the latest format of JadeLyrics which can be utilized in the latest software Music Visualizer 2.0.

You will need VsCode to built it easily and Java 21.

## Programs
TerminalVisualizer 
 - Runs in the terminal and directly renders to the terminal using ANSI Commands. Shows Lyrics and that's pretty much it.
 - Spotify Integration using D-Bus

MusicVisualizer
 - Runs as a window and has many more features.
  - Generates Lyrics
  - Fourier Transform of the system audio and audio selector.
  - Different themes.
  - Spotify Integration using D-Bus


## Extra Information for backstories

This program actually uses my DFT Engine which was originally scrapped from Music Visualizer 2.0 because it stopped working for some reason. It works here though so I kept it. And I also I can say with proof I implemented Discrete Fourier. >:)

Has the original training software back from May 2022 for my Dynamic Colours Machined Learnt Algorithm if you are interested in that shit. I don't use it anymore because training for slight betterment doesn't do me any better. 

Also the windowed Music Visualizer utilizes an old game engine called RenderEngineAJK me and several other friends developed back in high school. yea, but we didn't make the game though, ran out of time. ;-;

Overall, this was when I was experimenting with a lot of stuff. Rendering something to a terminal, using Discrete Fourier Transform on system audio, reading, writing and parsing files from another system, and of course a lot of animations. :)


If you need any more information on how to get it to run. Let me know through my stupid email: thejadesisfat77@gmail.com
